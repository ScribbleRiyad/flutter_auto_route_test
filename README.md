What is AutoRoute?
Auto Route is Flutter navigation package that allows for strongly-typed arguments passing, effortless deep-linking and code generation to simplify routes setup. It allows you to generate everything needed for navigation inside of your app with minimal code.

Why AutoRoute?
If your App requires deep-linking or guarded routes or just a clean routing setup you'll need to use named/generated routes and youâ€™ll end up writing a lot of boilerplate code for mediator argument classes, checking for required arguments, extracting arguments and a bunch of other stuff. See some of the many supported features in this package:
Named Routes
Path Parameters and Wildcard Matching
Nested Routes and Routers
Customizable Route Transitions
Deep Linking
Route Guards
Easy Bottom Navigation Bar Routing
Declarative Routing
Flow Routing
